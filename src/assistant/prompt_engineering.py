    prompt = f"""Analyze the following user query submitted to an AI Business Insights Assistant.
    Your goal is to understand the user's intent, identify key entities, and determine what *current, publicly available information* needs to be searched online to provide the best possible answer.

    **Business Context:**
    The assistant serves a mid-size enterprise with the following profile:
    {profile_str}

    **User Query:**
    "{query}"

    **Your Task:**
    Respond ONLY with a JSON object containing the following keys:
    1.  `query_type`: (String) Classify the primary intent. Choose ONE from: "competitive_analysis", "trend_forecasting", "swot_analysis", "market_research", "marketing_strategy", "financial_analysis", "operational_efficiency", "generic_business_question", "other".
    2.  `entities`: (Object) Extract key entities mentioned or implied. Include keys like:
        * `competitors`: (List of strings) Specific competitor names.
        * `industry`: (String) Target industry, if specified or implied. Default to business profile if relevant.
        * `products_services`: (List of strings) Specific products/services mentioned.
        * `geography`: (String) Geographic focus, if any.
        * `time_horizon`: (String) e.g., "next quarter", "1-3 years", "long-term".
        * `focus_areas`: (List of strings) Specific aspects to analyze (e.g., "pricing", "customer reviews", "technology stack").
        * `metrics`: (List of strings) Specific KPIs or metrics mentioned.
        * `original_query`: (String) The original user query text.
    3.  `required_searches`: (List of strings) Generate 10-15 specific, effective search engine queries (as strings) that would yield *current* information needed to thoroughly answer the user's query, considering the business context. Focus on information likely available publicly online (news, company websites, review sites, market reports summaries). Examples: "latest market share report [industry] [year]", "[Competitor Name] pricing model", "customer reviews [Competitor Name] [product]", "recent technology trends impacting [industry]". Avoid overly broad queries.

    **Example Output Format (Do NOT include this example in your actual response):**
    ```json
    {{
    "query_type": "competitive_analysis",
    "entities": {{
        "competitors": ["Acme Corp", "Beta Solutions"],
        "industry": "Mid-Market SaaS Solutions",
        "products_services": [],
        "geography": null,
        "time_horizon": null,
        "focus_areas": ["pricing", "customer support quality"],
        "metrics": [],
        "original_query": "How do we compare against Acme Corp and Beta Solutions on pricing and customer support?"
